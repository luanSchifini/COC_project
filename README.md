# ‚òÑÔ∏è Scientific Conference COC 

<p>ü§ìThis was my first ever project, designed while in high school!</p>
<p>üöÄThe first version was made in my second year, for the scool anual scientific conference. The goal was to count how many people have visited a student presentation.</p>
<p>üí∏The website worked so well, that in my third year the school paid me to develop this simpler and more efficient version, to use every year!</p>
